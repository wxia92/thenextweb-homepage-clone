Newsweek Homepage Clone by William Xia

Description:
This project is a fully responsive clone of the newsweek homepage.

What I Learned:
All article blocks in this page are responsive to screen sizes. When the screen becomes smaller, the articles are displayed in a single column. The header elements become hidden behind a drop-down element. Also, the latest news article blocks are displayed in a 2 column format rather than a 3 column format. All these responsive elements are achieved through media queries where I specified the screen sizes cut-off point to be 765 px.
